Use Case:
The goal is to create a solar system out of shapes. So for example, a yellow sphere acts as the sun and light source for the other "planets". The other shapes represent planets that revolve around the "sun". 

Autonomous Animation:
The autonomous animation is the rotation of "planets" around the "sun". Using the rotation matrix, we achieve this animation.

Interation Documentation:
We have two different perspectives, the Top View and the Front View. The purpose of these views are to show you two important perspectives that clearly show how the lighting works and how the planets rotate depending on the view you want.
