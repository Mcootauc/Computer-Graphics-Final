**_Our Own 3D Library_**

Mitchell Cootauco: Overall, I think we all should have put more time and effort because we could have done much better.\
Kevin Perez: As said by Mitchell, as well as making scene more interactive.
Gage Messner: I think we had the necessary parts but could have added more to make our scene more interactive.
