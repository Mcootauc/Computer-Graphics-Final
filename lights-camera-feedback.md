| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| | **Normal vectors** | |
| • Computation | Normal vectors are computed correctly | 10/10 |
| • Faceted and smooth looks | Faceted and smooth vectors are computed correctly | 5/5 |
| • Storage | Normals are appropriately stored within 3D objects | 9/9 |
| • GLSL | Normal vectors are passed into GLSL correctly | 6/6 |
| | **Lighting** | |
| • Modeling | Light is modeled well in the scene.  | 10/10 |
| • GLSL | Light is passed correctly to GLSL as a uniform variable | 10/10 |
| • Computation | Lighting computations are done correctly! | 20/20 |
| | **Camera** | |
| • Look-at | The look-at (camera) matrix is computed correctly | 10/10 |
| • Modeling | The camera object is modeled within the`Scene` object, however your functionality to change the camera isn't actually usable. You currently use hard coded-values which is fine, but make sure that you can switch between different camera views from a user's perspective.  | 7/7 |
| • Shader | The camera matrix is successfully passed into and used by the shader code | 3/3 |
| | **Usage in Scene** | |
| | The scene shows off the latest lighting and camera features | 10/10 |
| Texture mapping (if any) | n/a |  |
| Code maintainability | You have a several class methods that you call, but don't exist, as well as what are assumed to be defunct methods. Remember github allows you to restore any code you commit, so it's best to delete temporary methods when submitting (–2).  | -2 |
| Code readability | No readability issues found |  |
| Version control | Decent commit count with sufficiently descriptive messages |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit of tag: 04/19/23 11:24 PM<br /><br /> **Graded commit:** https://github.com/lmu-cmsi3710-spring2023/our-own-3d-library-mitch-gage-david-kevin/commit/c61e81be78040c0b3512e57f19f12b7c81063da4 |  |
