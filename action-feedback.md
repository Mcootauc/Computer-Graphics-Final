| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Sandbox scene | Sandbox scene is provided and functional | 10/10 |
| | **_pitch.md_** | |
| • Use case | Final scene is appropriately described | 3/3 |
| • Animation | Autonomous animation is clearly stated | 3/3 |
| • Interaction | User interaction is clearly stated | 3/3 |
| | **Autonomous animation** | |
| • Use case | Animation matches the use case | 4/4 |
| • Starter code difference | Animation differs from the startup code |  |
| • Implementation | No issues observed with animation implementation | 8/8 |
| | **Interaction** | |
| • Use case | Interaction fits the use case | 4/4 |
| • Starter code difference | Interaction is different than the starter code |  |
| • Implementation | Interaction is done well enough | 8/8 |
| | **Lighting** | |
| • Use case | Lighting choices fit the use case. It's very dim, but it makes sense, as space is also very dark and dim | 4/4 |
| • Implementation | No major issues observed with lighting | 8/8 |
| | **Technical milestones** | |
| • Camera | Camera settings appear to change as intended | 7/7 |
| • Wireframe/solid | Wireframe to solid toggling does not work on both macOS and Ubuntu, as it turns out. So the issue is not Mac-specific, which hints that it may still be a real bug that is either ignored or “forgiven” on Windows only. Either way, this was seen to be working on Windows so all good | 7/7 |
| • Projection | Projection appears to change as intended. Orthographic projection appears to be a little wonky (–1) | 6/7 |
| • Aspect ratio | Viewport appears to be non-square and matches the aspect ratio | 7/7 |
| • Scene add/remove | You don't actually add or remove an object from the scene. You just toggle whether it is visible or invisible (–7) | 0/7 |
| • Group add/remove | Group addition and removal does not exist (–7) | 0/7 |
| • Faceted/smooth | Toggling between smooth and faceted does not exist, but smooth and faceted looks are possible (–3) | 5/8 |
| _credits.md_ | _credits.md_ file describes who did what | 10/10 |
| Custom instructions | Custom setup/installation instructions not necessary |  |
| _commentary.md_ | Commentary provides clear answers to all 5 questions | 10/10 |
| _group-retrospective.md_ | Retrospective listed what each individual completed throughout the project, and individual retrospectives | 5/5 |
| Additional features | n/a |  |
| Code maintainability | No major maintainability issues found. However, there were warnings due to unused variables and improper operators being used. When submitting a final version of an assignment, please make sure that it is clean and that all possible errors have been checked (–1) | -1 |
| Code readability | No major readability issues |  |
| Version control | Decent commit count with sufficiently descriptive messages |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit: 05/04/23 12:11 AM <br><br>11 minutes late . . . . . (–1) | -1 |
| | **Total** | **110/130** |
